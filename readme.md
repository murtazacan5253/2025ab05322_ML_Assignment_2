# Machine Learning Assignment 2

## a. Problem Statement

The objective of this assignment is to implement and evaluate multiple machine learning classification models on a publicly available dataset and demonstrate their performance through an interactive Streamlit web application.

The project involves building six classification models on the same dataset, evaluating them using standard metrics, and comparing their performance.

This work demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline including:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model training
- Performance evaluation
- Deployment using Streamlit

## b. Dataset Characteristics

- Instances: ~48,000
- Features: 14
- Target Variable: income
- Classification Type: Binary

## c. Features included

- age
- workclass
- fnlwgt
- education
- education_num
- marital_status
- occupation
- relationship
- race
- sex
- capital_gain
- capital_loss
- hours_per_week
- native_country

## d. Target Classes

- <=50K
- >50K

## e. Data Preprocessing steps

- Replaced missing value indicators (?) with NaN
- Removed incomplete rows
- Encoded categorical features
- Scaled numerical features where require

## f. Models Used

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest (Ensemble)
- XGBoost (Ensemble)
